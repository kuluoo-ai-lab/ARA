INTENT:"The application to be created is based on the E-commerce (Digital Commerce) domain. It is intended to enable online buying and selling of products and services. The application shall include features such as product listing, offer creation, festive promotions, order placement, order enquiry, order tracking, offer notifications, account management, secure payment systems, business-side inventory management, product management, and overall order lifecycle handling. Inventory management is restricted to the business/admin side and not exposed to end users."
CREATE:"Create a full-scale E-commerce application aligned with the defined intent, supporting both user-facing and business/admin-facing functionalities.
BUILD:"Build the application using an optimized and industry-standard technology stack suitable for E-commerce platforms. Ensure high-quality code, modular architecture, API-driven design, responsive UI, reliable backend services, secure payment integration, and optimized performance under high traffic conditions."
PROCESS:"
WORKFLOW 
  STEP-1:Understand the complete E-commerce business requirements, user roles (customer, admin, seller), workflows, and domain-specific expectations.
  STEP-2:Identify or determine the most suitable technology stack (frontend, backend, database, payment gateway, notification service).
        If the user specifies a tech stack, store it in LOCAL_MEMORY.CACHE()
        If not specified, select the best-fit stack based on scalability, security, and performance needs and store it in LOCAL_MEMORY.CACHE()
  STEP-3:Define application architecture including:
        User-side modules (product browsing, cart, checkout, order tracking, account management)
        Admin/business-side modules (product management, inventory management, offer creation, order management, reporting)
  STEP-4:List all functional and non-functional requirements, including:
        Product listing and categorization
        Offer and festive promotion management
        Order placement, enquiry, and tracking
        Notification systems (email, SMS, push)
        Payment processing and transaction handling
        Security, scalability, and compliance requirements
        Convert these into a rule-based checklist.
STEP-5:Design detailed workflows for key processes such as checkout, payment confirmation, inventory update, order fulfillment, and notifications.
STEP-6:Implement frontend interfaces, backend services, APIs, database schemas, and third-party integrations based on the planned architecture.
STEP-7:Test all modules for functionality, performance, security, and edge cases, ensuring reliability across different devices and user scenarios.
STEP-8:Prepare the application for deployment with proper environment configuration, logging, monitoring, and scalability support."
ALTER:"Allow enhancements, feature updates, or behavioral changes based on evolving business requirements. Before applying modifications, obtain clear understanding of the requested change. Ask clarification questions only when user permission is granted."
MAINTAIN:"Maintain versioned releases of the application. Log all changes, enhancements, and bug fixes. Ensure rollback, redo, and historical version access is available for maintenance and auditing purposes."
RULE:"Follow E-commerce best practices and industry standards
Ensure secure payment handling and data privacy
Validate all user inputs and transactions
Avoid deprecated, insecure, or unsupported libraries
Ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and performance optimization"
MANAGE:"Manage application modules, configurations, releases, and feature sets efficiently. Maintain clear documentation for business logic, APIs, integrations, and operational procedures."
MONITOR:"Monitor application performance, transaction success rates, system health, inventory accuracy, and user activity. Establish thresholds and alerts to detect failures, anomalies, or misuse."
PROTECT:"Protect the application against security threats by implementing:
Secure authentication and authorization
Encrypted payment and user data handling
Regular dependency and vulnerability scanning
Compliance with applicable data protection and payment standards"
COLLABRATE:"Collaborate with available AI systems, development tools, and automation services to improve code quality, optimize performance, reduce development time, and ensure secure and consistent outputs."
EXECUTE:"Execute the entire application creation process by referencing all defined objectives, cached configurations, rules, workflows, and constraints to deliver a robust, scalable, and secure E-commerce platform."
