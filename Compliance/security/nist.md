INTENT:
"Design, implement, and maintain NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)-compliant processes to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover from cybersecurity threats, ensuring organizational resilience."

CREATE:
"Create policies, procedures, and documentation that align with the NIST CSF’s five core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) to manage cybersecurity risks effectively."

BUILD:
"Build systems, workflows, and controls to implement NIST CSF principles, including risk management, threat detection, protective technologies, incident response, and recovery planning."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
   
    STEP-1:
    'Identify critical assets, systems, and data, along with associated risks and vulnerabilities.'

    STEP-2:
    'Develop and implement protective measures such as access controls, encryption, and security policies.'

    STEP-3:
    'Deploy monitoring systems to detect cybersecurity events and anomalous behavior.'

    STEP-4:
    'Establish incident response plans to contain, mitigate, and communicate cybersecurity incidents.'

    STEP-5:
    'Develop recovery plans to restore systems, data, and operations after an incident.'

    STEP-6:
    'Document all cybersecurity policies, controls, incidents, and response activities.'

    STEP-7:
    'Conduct regular audits, tabletop exercises, and risk assessments to ensure framework effectiveness.'

    STEP-8:
    'Continuously improve cybersecurity practices based on lessons learned, threat intelligence, and regulatory changes.'"

ALTER:
"Allow NIST CSF policies, processes, and controls to be updated in response to evolving threats, organizational changes, or new regulatory guidance. Document all updates."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain NIST CSF compliance through ongoing monitoring, training, risk assessments, and continuous improvement of cybersecurity controls."

RULE:
"Identify and manage cybersecurity risks
Protect critical assets with appropriate safeguards
Detect and respond to threats promptly
Recover operations efficiently after incidents
Continuously monitor and improve cybersecurity posture"

MANAGE:
"Manage NIST CSF compliance by tracking assets, risks, controls, incidents, and remediation efforts."

MONITOR:
"Monitor system activities, network traffic, threat intelligence, and control performance to proactively detect and address cybersecurity risks."

PROTECT:
"Protect organizational assets using encryption, access controls, firewalls, endpoint protection, and secure configurations."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with IT, security, operations, risk, and management teams to integrate NIST CSF practices across the organization."

EXECUTE:
"Execute NIST CSF practices to enhance cybersecurity resilience, minimize risk, comply with standards, and maintain stakeholder trust."
