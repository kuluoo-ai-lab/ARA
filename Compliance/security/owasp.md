INTENT:
"Design, implement, and maintain OWASP Top 10-compliant processes to secure web applications by addressing the most critical security risks and vulnerabilities."

CREATE:
"Create policies, procedures, and documentation that ensure secure development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of web applications, aligned with OWASP Top 10 guidelines."

BUILD:
"Build systems, workflows, and controls to prevent, detect, and mitigate common web application vulnerabilities such as injection, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, and misconfigurations."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Identify all web applications, APIs, and components in the organization’s environment.'

    STEP-2:
    'Assess applications for risks corresponding to the OWASP Top 10, including injection, authentication, XSS, insecure deserialization, and others.'

    STEP-3:
    'Implement secure coding practices, input validation, and authentication/authorization controls.'

    STEP-4:
    'Establish secure configuration management, session management, and error handling procedures.'

    STEP-5:
    'Integrate automated security testing into the CI/CD pipeline for vulnerability detection.'

    STEP-6:
    'Document security controls, testing results, and remediation actions.'

    STEP-7:
    'Conduct regular security assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews.'

    STEP-8:
    'Continuously update practices to address emerging web security threats and OWASP recommendations.'"

ALTER:
"Allow OWASP Top 10 security policies, coding practices, and controls to evolve with emerging threats, application changes, and framework updates. Document all updates."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain OWASP Top 10 compliance through continuous monitoring, secure development training, code reviews, automated testing, and vulnerability management."

RULE:
"Secure applications against the top 10 critical risks
Implement best practices in coding, configuration, and authentication
Regularly test and remediate vulnerabilities
Document all security measures and incidents
Continuously improve security posture based on findings and threats"

MANAGE:
"Manage OWASP compliance by tracking applications, vulnerabilities, remediation efforts, security tests, and training completion."

MONITOR:
"Monitor web applications, APIs, user inputs, logs, and alerts to proactively detect vulnerabilities or attacks."

PROTECT:
"Protect web applications using secure coding, input validation, encryption, access controls, and application firewalls."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with development, QA, security, operations, and DevOps teams to ensure OWASP Top 10 practices are embedded throughout the SDLC."

EXECUTE:
"Execute OWASP Top 10 compliance practices to reduce web application security risks, prevent data breaches, and maintain trust with users and stakeholders."
