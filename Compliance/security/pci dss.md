INTENT:
"Design, implement, and maintain PCI DSS-compliant processes to ensure the security of payment card data and protect cardholder information throughout the payment ecosystem."

CREATE:
"Create policies, procedures, and documentation that govern the collection, processing, transmission, and storage of payment card data, aligned with PCI DSS requirements."

BUILD:
"Build systems, workflows, and controls that enforce PCI DSS principles, including network security, encryption, access controls, monitoring, and vulnerability management."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
  
    STEP-1:
    'Identify all systems, applications, and processes that store, process, or transmit cardholder data.'

    STEP-2:
    'Implement network segmentation and secure architecture to isolate cardholder data environments (CDE).'

    STEP-3:
    'Enforce strong access controls: authentication, least privilege, and user activity logging.'

    STEP-4:
    'Encrypt cardholder data at rest and in transit using industry-approved methods.'

    STEP-5:
    'Regularly monitor and test networks, systems, and applications for vulnerabilities.'

    STEP-6:
    'Maintain secure software development practices and patch management.'

    STEP-7:
    'Document all PCI DSS controls, policies, and operational procedures.'

    STEP-8:
    'Conduct periodic internal audits, gap assessments, and external compliance validation.'"

ALTER:
"Allow PCI DSS policies, processes, and controls to evolve with changes in technology, threat landscape, or regulatory updates. Document all updates for audit purposes."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain PCI DSS compliance through continuous monitoring, training, vulnerability management, and regular security testing."

RULE:
"Protect cardholder data at all stages
Implement strong access and authentication controls
Maintain secure systems and networks
Regularly monitor and test security controls
Document and review compliance continuously"

MANAGE:
"Manage PCI DSS compliance by tracking cardholder data flows, control implementation, audit findings, and remediation actions."

MONITOR:
"Monitor networks, applications, user activities, and security incidents to proactively detect threats and vulnerabilities."

PROTECT:
"Protect payment card data using encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection, access control, and incident response procedures."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with IT, security, operations, finance, and third-party vendors to ensure PCI DSS compliance across the payment ecosystem."

EXECUTE:
"Execute PCI DSS compliance practices to safeguard cardholder data, reduce risk of breaches, maintain customer trust, and meet regulatory obligations."
