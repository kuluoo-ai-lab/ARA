INTENT:
"Design and implement the application using an Event-Driven Architecture, where system components communicate through events. This architecture is intended for applications that require real-time processing, asynchronous workflows, high responsiveness, and loose coupling between components."

CREATE:
"Create an application composed of event producers, event consumers, and event channels. The system should react to events such as user actions, system triggers, or external messages without tight synchronous dependencies."

BUILD:
"Build the application using event-based communication mechanisms such as message queues, event streams, or brokers. Ensure reliable event delivery, scalability, fault tolerance, and asynchronous processing."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Understand the application scope and identify events generated by user actions, system processes, or external integrations.'

    STEP-2:
    'Select or confirm an event-driven technology stack including event brokers, consumers, and producers.
    If specified by the user, store the stack in LOCAL_MEMORY.CACHE()
    If not specified, choose a suitable event-driven stack and store it in LOCAL_MEMORY.CACHE()'

    STEP-3:
    'Define event producers responsible for emitting events when state changes occur in the system.'

    STEP-4:
    'Define event consumers that listen to and process specific event types independently.'

    STEP-5:
    'Design event schemas, payload structures, and routing rules to ensure consistent and reliable communication.'

    STEP-6:
    'Implement asynchronous event handling logic with retry mechanisms and failure handling.'

    STEP-7:
    'Test event flows, message ordering, idempotency, and system behavior under load and failure conditions.'

    STEP-8:
    'Deploy event producers, consumers, and brokers with proper configuration, monitoring, and scaling strategies.'"

ALTER:
"Allow independent changes to event producers or consumers without impacting other components, provided event contracts remain unchanged or properly versioned."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain versioned event schemas and consumer logic. Track changes to event formats and ensure backward compatibility or controlled migration."

RULE:
"Ensure loose coupling between producers and consumers
Maintain immutable and well-defined event schemas
Handle duplicate and out-of-order events safely
Avoid synchronous dependencies between event handlers
Ensure reliable event delivery and error recovery"

MANAGE:
"Manage event definitions, schema versions, consumer registrations, and infrastructure configurations centrally with proper documentation."

MONITOR:
"Monitor event throughput, processing latency, consumer lag, failures, and retry rates. Establish alerts for event backlogs and system anomalies."

PROTECT:
"Protect the event-driven system by securing event channels, validating event payloads, enforcing access control, and monitoring for malicious or malformed events."

COLLABORATE:
"Use AI tools, stream processing frameworks, and automation to optimize event flow design, processing efficiency, and system reliability."

EXECUTE:
"Execute the application development and deployment by strictly following the defined intent, architecture rules, workflows, and operational boundaries of the Event-Driven Architecture."
