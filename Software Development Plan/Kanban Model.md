INTENT:
"Design, develop, and deploy the application using the Kanban Software Development Model. The system must be delivered through continuous flow, visualized work, and controlled work-in-progress (WIP) limits. This model is intended for projects requiring flexibility, real-time task management, and gradual, continuous delivery without fixed iterations."

CREATE:
"Create a software system by breaking work into manageable tasks visualized on a Kanban board. Tasks are pulled based on team capacity, ensuring smooth, continuous progress and minimizing bottlenecks."

BUILD:
"Build features in a continuous, pull-based workflow where tasks are developed, tested, and deployed as soon as team capacity allows. Emphasize flow optimization, incremental delivery, and high-quality output."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Visualize all work items using a Kanban board with columns representing workflow stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Testing, Done).'

    STEP-2:
    'Define explicit work-in-progress (WIP) limits for each stage to prevent overload and maintain focus.'

    STEP-3:
    'Pull tasks from the backlog as team members become available, ensuring no stage exceeds its WIP limit.'

    STEP-4:
    'Continuously develop, test, and deploy work items. Maintain quality through automated testing and peer reviews.'

    STEP-5:
    'Monitor workflow, identify bottlenecks, and make adjustments to improve throughput and efficiency.'

    STEP-6:
    'Continuously review and reprioritize backlog items based on stakeholder feedback or business needs.'"

ALTER:
"Allow reprioritization and task adjustments at any time. Workflow can be modified dynamically to optimize throughput, provided WIP limits and task dependencies are respected."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain the system through ongoing enhancements, updates, and bug fixes. Track changes, WIP metrics, and throughput to ensure continuous improvement."

RULE:
"Visualize all tasks
Limit work-in-progress
Optimize flow continuously
Deliver incrementally
Emphasize quality and feedback"

MANAGE:
"Manage development using Kanban boards, workflow analytics, WIP metrics, and real-time collaboration tools. Facilitate team alignment through regular stand-ups and reviews."

MONITOR:
"Monitor cycle time, lead time, throughput, bottlenecks, and task completion rates. Use metrics to identify process improvements."

PROTECT:
"Protect system stability by preventing overloading, maintaining quality checks, and enforcing WIP limits."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate through real-time board updates, shared task ownership, and frequent communication to maintain transparency and team alignment."

EXECUTE:
"Execute development by continuously delivering work items, optimizing flow, and maintaining visibility of all tasks in accordance with Kanban principles."
