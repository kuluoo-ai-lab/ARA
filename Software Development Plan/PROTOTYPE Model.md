INTENT:
"Design, develop, and deploy the application using the Prototype Software Development Model. The system must be built by first creating one or more prototypes to clearly understand, validate, and refine user requirements before developing the final solution. This model is intended for projects where requirements are unclear, complex, or expected to evolve through user interaction."

CREATE:
"Create an initial prototype that represents key system functionalities, workflows, and user interfaces. Use the prototype as a communication and validation tool to refine requirements prior to building the final system."

BUILD:
"Build the final system by iteratively refining prototypes based on user feedback. Transition validated prototype features into a robust, production-ready implementation."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Collect initial and high-level requirements from stakeholders and users, focusing on core needs and expectations.'

    STEP-2:
    'Design and develop a prototype that demonstrates critical features, user interactions, and system behavior.'

    STEP-3:
    'Present the prototype to users and stakeholders for evaluation and feedback.'

    STEP-4:
    'Analyze feedback to identify requirement gaps, usability issues, and improvement opportunities.'

    STEP-5:
    'Refine requirements and update the prototype iteratively until requirements are clearly understood and validated.'

    STEP-6:
    'Develop the final system based on the validated requirements and refined prototype design.'

    STEP-7:
    'Test, deploy, and maintain the final system following standard quality and release practices.'"

ALTER:
"Allow changes throughout the prototyping phase. Once requirements are finalized and approved, changes must follow controlled change management procedures."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain the system after deployment through structured updates, bug fixes, and enhancements. Preserve traceability between prototype decisions and final implementation."

RULE:
"Prototype early and iteratively
Use prototypes to validate requirements, not as final code
Actively involve users in evaluation
Clearly define when prototyping ends and final development begins
Prevent scope creep during prototype refinement"

MANAGE:
"Manage the development process by tracking prototype iterations, user feedback, requirement changes, and approval checkpoints before final implementation."

MONITOR:
"Monitor requirement clarity, user satisfaction, feedback trends, and readiness to transition from prototype to final development."

PROTECT:
"Protect the project from requirement ambiguity and scope creep by enforcing validation checkpoints and clear sign-off before final system build."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate closely with users, designers, analysts, and developers through frequent prototype demonstrations, workshops, and review sessions."

EXECUTE:
"Execute development by leveraging prototypes to achieve clear, validated requirements and then delivering a stable, high-quality system based on those validated insights."
