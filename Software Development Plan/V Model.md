INTENT:
"Design, develop, and deploy the application using the V-Model (Verification and Validation Model). The system must be developed in a sequential manner where every development phase has a corresponding testing phase. This model is intended for projects with clearly defined requirements and a need for high-quality assurance through formal validation at each stage."

CREATE:
"Create a software system by aligning development activities with their corresponding testing activities. Each module, component, and integration must be verified against defined specifications and validated against requirements."

BUILD:
"Build the system by progressing linearly through requirements, design, implementation, and coding phases, ensuring that each phase has a predefined test plan executed in parallel."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Collect and document all functional and non-functional requirements.
     Define acceptance criteria and corresponding user acceptance tests (UAT).'

    STEP-2:
    'Design system architecture (High-Level Design) and component-level specifications (Low-Level Design).
     Prepare system and integration test plans corresponding to design elements.'

    STEP-3:
    'Implement modules according to approved specifications.
     Develop unit tests for each module in parallel.'

    STEP-4:
    'Perform unit testing for individual modules.'

    STEP-5:
    'Conduct integration testing to verify interactions between modules.'

    STEP-6:
    'Perform system testing to ensure the system meets functional and non-functional requirements.'

    STEP-7:
    'Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to validate that the system fulfills business objectives.'"

ALTER:
"Allow changes only through formal re-validation processes, ensuring that any modification is assessed against all corresponding testing activities."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain the system with structured regression testing, version control, and controlled updates to ensure continued compliance with specifications."

RULE:
"Each development phase must have a corresponding test phase
Formal documentation and approvals are mandatory
Requirements should be stable
Testing is planned early and executed rigorously"

MANAGE:
"Manage development using milestone-based verification checkpoints and testing sign-offs for each phase."

MONITOR:
"Monitor test coverage, defect detection rates, validation results, and phase completion metrics."

PROTECT:
"Protect system quality through comprehensive testing at all levels, controlled change management, and adherence to design specifications."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate between development, testing, and stakeholder teams to ensure verification and validation are completed consistently."

EXECUTE:
"Execute development by strictly following the V-Model lifecycle, aligning every development phase with its corresponding testing phase to ensure high-quality and verified deliverables."
