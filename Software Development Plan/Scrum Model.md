INTENT:
"Design, develop, and deploy the application using the Scrum framework. The system must be delivered through fixed-duration sprints, leveraging defined Scrum roles, events, and artifacts to achieve iterative, incremental delivery. This model is intended for complex projects requiring frequent feedback, transparency, and adaptability."

CREATE:
"Create a software system in incremental, potentially shippable parts. Each sprint delivers features that are fully developed, tested, and reviewed by stakeholders, ensuring continuous alignment with business priorities."

BUILD:
"Build features during time-boxed sprints, with cross-functional teams collaboratively implementing user stories. Emphasize iterative design, continuous integration, and automated testing to ensure quality and readiness for deployment."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Define and maintain a product backlog containing prioritized user stories, features, and enhancements with clear acceptance criteria.'

    STEP-2:
    'Conduct sprint planning sessions to select user stories for the upcoming sprint based on team capacity and priority.'

    STEP-3:
    'Develop and test user stories within the sprint timeframe.
     Ensure each increment meets the Definition of Done (DoD) and passes automated and manual tests.'

    STEP-4:
    'Hold daily Scrum meetings (stand-ups) to review progress, identify blockers, and synchronize team efforts.'

    STEP-5:
    'Conduct sprint review sessions at the end of the sprint to demonstrate completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.'

    STEP-6:
    'Facilitate sprint retrospectives to evaluate team performance, process effectiveness, and areas for improvement.'

    STEP-7:
    'Refine the product backlog based on feedback, changing requirements, or new insights, preparing for the next sprint.'"

ALTER:
"Allow backlog reprioritization between sprints based on stakeholder feedback or market changes. Scope changes during a sprint should be avoided unless critical and approved."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain the system through continuous integration, refactoring, and enhancement. Track issues, defects, and feature updates across sprints for long-term system stability."

RULE:
"Follow Scrum roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
Time-boxed sprints with clear goals
Adhere to Definition of Done for all deliverables
Conduct all Scrum ceremonies consistently
Emphasize transparency, inspection, and adaptation"

MANAGE:
"Manage development using Scrum artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment), sprint planning, burndown charts, and velocity tracking."

MONITOR:
"Monitor sprint progress, impediments, team performance, and stakeholder feedback. Adjust team focus or backlog priorities as needed."

PROTECT:
"Protect sprint objectives by limiting mid-sprint changes. Ensure quality through testing, automated CI/CD pipelines, and adherence to the Definition of Done."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate through cross-functional teams, Scrum events, and shared tools for real-time communication, backlog management, and documentation."

EXECUTE:
"Execute development following Scrum principles, roles, events, and artifacts to deliver incremental value while ensuring flexibility, transparency, and stakeholder alignment."
