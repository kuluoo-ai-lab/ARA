INTENT:
"Design, develop, and deploy the application using the Waterfall Software Development Model. The system must be built through a strictly linear and sequential lifecycle where each phase is fully completed, reviewed, documented, and approved before the next phase begins. This model is intended for projects with clearly defined, stable, and well-understood requirements where predictability, documentation, and formal governance are critical."

CREATE:
"Create a fully documented software system by executing a predefined sequence of phases including requirements analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase must produce formal deliverables that serve as mandatory inputs for the next phase."

BUILD:
"Build the system in a disciplined, phase-driven manner. Development activities must strictly conform to approved specifications and architectural designs. No implementation work may begin without formal sign-off of the previous phase."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
  
    STEP-1:
    'Conduct comprehensive requirement gathering sessions with all stakeholders.
     Document functional, non-functional, regulatory, and operational requirements in a formal Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
     Validate and obtain stakeholder approval before proceeding.'

    STEP-2:
    'Design the complete system architecture, data models, interfaces, and detailed technical specifications.
     Produce System Design Documents (SDD), High-Level Design (HLD), and Low-Level Design (LLD).
     Perform design reviews and obtain formal approval.'

    STEP-3:
    'Implement the system strictly according to the approved design documents.
     Follow coding standards, version control policies, and internal development guidelines.
     No design changes are allowed during this phase without formal change approval.'

    STEP-4:
    'Perform structured testing including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
     Validate the implementation against the approved requirements and design specifications.
     Log, track, and resolve defects through a controlled defect management process.'

    STEP-5:
    'Prepare deployment artifacts, installation guides, and operational documentation.
     Deploy the system into the production environment following approved release procedures.'

    STEP-6:
    'Provide post-deployment maintenance, support, and controlled enhancements.
     Address defects, security patches, and compliance updates under formal change management.'"

ALTER:
"Allow changes only through a formal change request process. All change requests must include impact analysis, cost estimation, schedule adjustments, and approval from designated governance authorities before implementation."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain the system through scheduled maintenance cycles, structured bug fixes, and versioned releases. Ensure all maintenance activities are documented and traceable to approved change requests."

RULE:
"Each phase must be completed and approved before the next phase begins
Comprehensive documentation is mandatory at every stage
Requirements must remain stable throughout development
Changes must follow formal change control procedures
Phase overlap is not permitted"

MANAGE:
"Manage the project using milestone-based planning, phase-gate reviews, formal approvals, and detailed project schedules. Track progress against predefined deliverables, timelines, and budgets."

MONITOR:
"Monitor phase completion status, documentation quality, defect metrics, schedule adherence, and cost variance throughout the project lifecycle."

PROTECT:
"Protect the system and project integrity through access control, approval workflows, audit trails, compliance checks, and controlled artifact repositories."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate using formal communication channels, review meetings, documented sign-offs, and centralized documentation repositories to ensure alignment across all stakeholders."

EXECUTE:
"Execute the application development strictly according to the linear, sequential lifecycle, governance controls, and documentation standards defined by the Waterfall Software Development Model."
