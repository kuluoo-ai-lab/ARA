INTENT:
"Design, develop, and deploy the application using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model. The system must be delivered quickly through rapid prototyping, iterative development, and continuous user involvement. This model is intended for projects requiring fast time-to-market, flexible requirements, and high user interaction."

CREATE:
"Create a software system rapidly by using reusable components, prototypes, and parallel development activities. Emphasize early visibility of functionality and frequent user validation."

BUILD:
"Build the system through short, intensive development cycles with continuous user feedback. Development, testing, and refinement occur in parallel to accelerate delivery."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Gather high-level business requirements and define system scope.
     Focus on essential features rather than exhaustive documentation.'

    STEP-2:
    'Design quick prototypes to represent system workflows, interfaces, and key functionalities.'

    STEP-3:
    'Review prototypes with users and stakeholders.
     Collect feedback and immediately refine requirements and design.'

    STEP-4:
    'Develop system components using reusable modules and parallel development teams.'

    STEP-5:
    'Continuously test and integrate components to ensure stability and usability.'

    STEP-6:
    'Finalize the system, perform user validation, and deploy to production.'"

ALTER:
"Allow frequent and rapid changes to requirements and design based on continuous user feedback, without heavy change control procedures."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain the system through rapid updates, enhancements, and fixes. Continue leveraging reusable components and fast iteration cycles post-deployment."

RULE:
"Speed and user feedback are prioritized
Extensive prototyping is mandatory
Users must be actively involved
Reuse components wherever possible
Documentation is lightweight but sufficient"

MANAGE:
"Manage development through time-boxed iterations, close stakeholder collaboration, and frequent review checkpoints rather than rigid phase gates."

MONITOR:
"Monitor delivery speed, prototype acceptance, user satisfaction, defect trends, and iteration turnaround time."

PROTECT:
"Protect core business requirements by validating them early through prototypes and ensuring rapid testing to prevent functional regressions."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate closely with users, designers, developers, and testers using workshops, prototype reviews, and real-time communication tools."

EXECUTE:
"Execute development with a strong focus on rapid delivery, continuous user feedback, and iterative refinement as defined by the RAD Model."
