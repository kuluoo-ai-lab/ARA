INTENT:
"Design, develop, and deploy the application using the Iterative Software Development Model. The system must be built through repeated cycles of development, evaluation, and refinement. This model is intended for projects where requirements may evolve and early partial solutions provide feedback for continuous improvement."

CREATE:
"Create a software system incrementally by delivering initial prototypes or partial implementations, then refining the system through successive iterations based on feedback and testing."

BUILD:
"Build the system in repeated iterations, gradually enhancing features, improving design, and integrating functionality. Each iteration produces a working, testable version of the system."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Develop an initial version of the system that covers core functionality.'

    STEP-2:
    'Test the initial implementation to identify defects, usability issues, and missing features.'

    STEP-3:
    'Collect feedback from stakeholders, users, and development teams to refine requirements.'

    STEP-4:
    'Enhance, extend, and improve the system in the next iteration based on feedback and testing results.'

    STEP-5:
    'Repeat iterative cycles until the system meets all functional, non-functional, and business requirements.'"

ALTER:
"Allow changes and refinements at the beginning of each iteration, ensuring the system evolves based on feedback and updated requirements."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain the system through iterative updates, continuous testing, and incremental improvements. Track changes and version history across iterations."

RULE:
"Deliver incremental functionality in each iteration
Incorporate stakeholder feedback continuously
Refine requirements and design iteratively
Ensure each iteration produces a working system"

MANAGE:
"Manage iterations using iteration planning, progress tracking, and review sessions. Prioritize work based on stakeholder needs and feedback."

MONITOR:
"Monitor iteration progress, defect rates, feedback implementation, and system performance throughout the development lifecycle."

PROTECT:
"Protect the integrity of the evolving system through regression testing, version control, and controlled iteration cycles."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with stakeholders, users, and development teams continuously to refine features, address issues, and adapt the system to changing requirements."

EXECUTE:
"Execute development using repeated iterative cycles, focusing on incremental delivery, feedback incorporation, and progressive system refinement."
