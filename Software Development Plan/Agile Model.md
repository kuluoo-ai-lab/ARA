INTENT:
"Design, develop, and deploy the application using the Agile Software Development Model. The system must be delivered incrementally and iteratively, emphasizing flexibility, continuous stakeholder collaboration, rapid feedback, and adaptive planning. This model is intended for projects with evolving or unclear requirements, high uncertainty, and the need for fast delivery of value."

CREATE:
"Create a software system through iterative cycles, delivering small, usable increments of working software frequently. Requirements and priorities are continuously refined based on stakeholder feedback and evolving business needs."

BUILD:
"Build the system in short iterations (sprints) with each increment fully tested and deployable. Development teams must embrace adaptive planning, iterative design, and continuous integration while ensuring high-quality, working software at the end of each cycle."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Gather and prioritize initial requirements in a product backlog.
     Involve stakeholders to define high-level features and acceptance criteria.'

    STEP-2:
    'Plan iterations (sprints) by selecting the highest priority items from the backlog.
     Define sprint goals and expected deliverables.'

    STEP-3:
    'Design, develop, and test selected features within the sprint timeframe.
     Perform continuous integration, automated testing, and peer code reviews.'

    STEP-4:
    'Conduct sprint review meetings to demonstrate completed features to stakeholders.
     Gather feedback and adjust the backlog accordingly.'

    STEP-5:
    'Hold sprint retrospective sessions to evaluate team performance, process efficiency, and improvement opportunities.'

    STEP-6:
    'Repeat the iterative cycle until the product meets business goals and quality standards.'"

ALTER:
"Allow requirement changes at any stage of development based on stakeholder feedback or market shifts, provided the backlog is reprioritized and communicated clearly to the team."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain the system through continuous refactoring, updates, and enhancements between iterations. Ensure code quality, documentation, and test coverage are preserved across releases."

RULE:
"Deliver working software frequently
Embrace change and evolving requirements
Collaborate closely with stakeholders
Maintain sustainable development pace
Use iterative design and testing"

MANAGE:
"Manage development using Agile ceremonies, including sprint planning, daily stand-ups, backlog grooming, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. Track progress using burndown charts, velocity metrics, and incremental delivery tracking."

MONITOR:
"Monitor sprint progress, backlog health, team velocity, defect density, and customer satisfaction. Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies early."

PROTECT:
"Protect the product by enforcing continuous testing, code reviews, automated integration, and early detection of defects. Ensure security and compliance requirements are incorporated in each iteration."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate continuously with cross-functional teams, product owners, and stakeholders using Agile tools, real-time communication channels, and shared documentation platforms."

EXECUTE:
"Execute development by strictly following iterative Agile cycles, prioritizing working software, stakeholder feedback, and adaptive planning to achieve maximum business value."
