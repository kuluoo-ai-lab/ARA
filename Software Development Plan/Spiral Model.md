INTENT:
"Design, develop, and deploy the application using the Spiral Software Development Model. The system must be built through iterative cycles with a strong focus on risk analysis, risk mitigation, and progressive refinement. This model is intended for large, complex, and high-risk projects where requirements are unclear or likely to evolve."

CREATE:
"Create a software system incrementally by repeatedly refining requirements, design, and implementation through multiple spiral cycles. Each cycle incorporates risk assessment, prototyping, development, and evaluation."

BUILD:
"Build the system in iterative increments, addressing risks early and refining functionality over successive cycles. Emphasize adaptive planning, user feedback, and continuous evaluation."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Define objectives, constraints, and alternatives for the current cycle.
     Identify critical success factors and project assumptions.'

    STEP-2:
    'Perform detailed risk analysis for technical, operational, and schedule-related risks.
     Develop mitigation strategies for high-risk areas.'

    STEP-3:
    'Develop prototypes or partial implementations to validate concepts and reduce uncertainty.'

    STEP-4:
    'Review and evaluate the prototype or increment with stakeholders.
     Gather feedback and refine requirements and designs for the next cycle.'

    STEP-5:
    'Plan the next spiral iteration based on lessons learned, risk assessment, and evolving requirements.'

    STEP-6:
    'Repeat cycles until the system meets requirements and risk is minimized.'"

ALTER:
"Allow changes in requirements, design, or priorities at the beginning of each spiral cycle, guided by risk assessment and stakeholder feedback."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain the system through continuous risk evaluation, incremental updates, and iterative refinement to ensure stability and adaptability."

RULE:
"Focus on early risk identification and mitigation
Iterative development with multiple cycles
Incorporate stakeholder feedback after each cycle
Document risk and decisions at every iteration"

MANAGE:
"Manage the project by tracking risk metrics, cycle progress, prototypes, and stakeholder approvals at the end of each spiral iteration."

MONITOR:
"Monitor risk levels, prototype outcomes, iteration progress, and requirement changes continuously."

PROTECT:
"Protect the system by addressing high-risk components early, validating designs via prototypes, and incorporating risk mitigation strategies in each cycle."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with stakeholders, risk analysts, and development teams through continuous feedback loops, risk reviews, and prototype evaluations."

EXECUTE:
"Execute development following iterative spiral cycles, prioritizing risk reduction, continuous refinement, and stakeholder validation for high-risk, complex projects."
