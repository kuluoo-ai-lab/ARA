INTENT:
"Design, implement, and operate Monitoring and Observability to provide visibility into system health, performance, and behavior, enabling proactive detection and resolution of issues."

CREATE:
"Create observability frameworks that collect logs, metrics, and traces to accurately reflect system state and behavior."

BUILD:
"Build monitoring systems using logging, metrics collection, tracing, dashboards, and alerting tools."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
   
    STEP-1:
    'Define observability goals, SLIs, SLOs, and KPIs.'

    STEP-2:
    'Instrument applications and infrastructure for metrics, logs, and traces.'

    STEP-3:
    'Centralize log and metric collection.'

    STEP-4:
    'Create dashboards and visualizations.'

    STEP-5:
    'Configure alerts and notifications.'

    STEP-6:
    'Implement distributed tracing where applicable.'

    STEP-7:
    'Test alert accuracy and noise levels.'

    STEP-8:
    'Continuously refine observability based on incidents and usage.'"

ALTER:
"Allow adjustments to monitoring configurations and alert thresholds based on operational insights."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain observability systems through tool upgrades, dashboard updates, alert tuning, and data retention management."

RULE:
"Monitor what matters
Avoid alert fatigue
Ensure actionable alerts
Correlate logs, metrics, and traces
Retain data appropriately
Document monitoring practices"

MANAGE:
"Manage observability by tracking incident trends, alert effectiveness, system reliability, and operational metrics."

MONITOR:
"Monitor system uptime, latency, error rates, throughput, and resource usage continuously."

PROTECT:
"Protect observability data from unauthorized access and ensure monitoring systems remain highly available."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with DevOps, SRE, development, and support teams to improve system reliability."

EXECUTE:
"Execute monitoring and observability practices to maintain system stability, performance, and reliability."
