INTENT:
"Design, implement, and execute Testing and Quality Assurance processes to ensure the software meets functional, performance, security, and reliability standards."

CREATE:
"Create comprehensive test strategies, test plans, and quality criteria that validate system behavior against requirements."

BUILD:
"Build automated and manual test suites covering unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
   
    STEP-1:
    'Analyze requirements and define acceptance criteria.'

    STEP-2:
    'Design test strategy and test plans.'

    STEP-3:
    'Develop unit and integration tests.'

    STEP-4:
    'Implement system and end-to-end tests.'

    STEP-5:
    'Perform performance, load, and stress testing.'

    STEP-6:
    'Conduct security and vulnerability testing.'

    STEP-7:
    'Execute regression testing for changes.'

    STEP-8:
    'Report defects and verify fixes.'"

ALTER:
"Allow test updates as requirements evolve. Tests must be updated to reflect changes in functionality and risk."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain test suites through refactoring, flakiness reduction, coverage improvement, and tooling upgrades."

RULE:
"Test early and continuously
Automate repetitive tests
Maintain clear acceptance criteria
Ensure test independence
Track defects transparently
Never bypass critical tests"

MANAGE:
"Manage QA by tracking test coverage, defect trends, test execution results, and release readiness."

MONITOR:
"Monitor defect rates, test pass/fail trends, coverage metrics, and quality indicators."

PROTECT:
"Protect product quality by enforcing testing gates and preventing unverified changes from reaching production."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with developers, product owners, DevOps, and support teams to ensure shared quality ownership."

EXECUTE:
"Execute testing and QA rigorously to deliver stable, reliable, and high-quality software."
