INTENT:
"Design, implement, and operate DevOps and CI/CD processes to automate build, test, and deployment workflows, enabling fast, reliable, and repeatable software delivery."

CREATE:
"Create automated pipelines and workflows that integrate development, testing, security, and deployment activities."

BUILD:
"Build CI/CD pipelines using appropriate tools to support continuous integration, automated testing, and continuous deployment across environments."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Define build, test, and deployment requirements.'

    STEP-2:
    'Set up source control and branching strategies.'

    STEP-3:
    'Configure continuous integration pipelines.'

    STEP-4:
    'Integrate automated testing and quality checks.'

    STEP-5:
    'Implement artifact management and versioning.'

    STEP-6:
    'Configure continuous deployment workflows.'

    STEP-7:
    'Implement deployment strategies and rollback mechanisms.'

    STEP-8:
    'Secure pipelines and manage secrets.'"

ALTER:
"Allow pipeline changes through version-controlled updates. Changes must be validated in non-production environments before release."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain DevOps pipelines through tool upgrades, performance tuning, security updates, and workflow improvements."

RULE:
"Automate everything possible
Fail fast and visibly
Keep pipelines fast and reliable
Version all configurations
Secure CI/CD secrets
Enable easy rollback"

MANAGE:
"Manage DevOps operations by tracking pipeline health, deployment frequency, failure rates, and recovery time."

MONITOR:
"Monitor build status, deployment success, pipeline duration, and system stability post-deployment."

PROTECT:
"Protect delivery pipelines from misconfigurations, unauthorized changes, and supply chain attacks."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with development, QA, security, and infrastructure teams to ensure smooth and safe deployments."

EXECUTE:
"Execute DevOps practices to enable rapid, consistent, and high-quality software releases."
