INTENT:
"Design, implement, and manage integrations with external systems and third-party services to extend system functionality and enable reliable data exchange."

CREATE:
"Create integration architectures and contracts that define how external services interact with the system."

BUILD:
"Build integrations using APIs, webhooks, message queues, and event-driven mechanisms while ensuring reliability and security."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Identify external systems, services, and integration requirements.'

    STEP-2:
    'Define integration patterns, data formats, and communication protocols.'

    STEP-3:
    'Design error handling, retries, and fallback mechanisms.'

    STEP-4:
    'Implement integration interfaces and adapters.'

    STEP-5:
    'Secure integrations using authentication and authorization mechanisms.'

    STEP-6:
    'Test integrations for functionality, performance, and failure scenarios.'

    STEP-7:
    'Document integration contracts and usage guidelines.'

    STEP-8:
    'Monitor integration reliability and usage.'"

ALTER:
"Allow controlled changes to integrations through versioning and compatibility management."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain integrations through dependency updates, contract reviews, and performance tuning."

RULE:
"Design for loose coupling
Handle failures gracefully
Secure all integrations
Respect rate limits
Document all external dependencies
Monitor third-party SLAs"

MANAGE:
"Manage integrations by tracking dependencies, versions, contracts, and external service health."

MONITOR:
"Monitor integration success rates, latency, error patterns, and third-party availability."

PROTECT:
"Protect the system from external failures and security risks through isolation, validation, and fallback strategies."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with external partners, internal teams, and security stakeholders to ensure smooth integrations."

EXECUTE:
"Execute integrations with reliability and resilience to safely extend system capabilities."
