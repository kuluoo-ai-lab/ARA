INTENT:
"Design, implement, and manage the Database and Data Storage layer to reliably store, retrieve, and protect application data. The data layer must ensure integrity, consistency, availability, performance, and scalability."

CREATE:
"Create logical and physical data models that accurately represent business entities, relationships, and data lifecycle requirements."

BUILD:
"Build database systems using appropriate storage technologies such as relational, NoSQL, or object storage. Implement schemas, indexes, constraints, and access patterns optimized for application needs."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
   
    STEP-1:
    'Analyze data requirements, access patterns, and consistency needs.'

    STEP-2:
    'Design logical data models and normalize or denormalize as required.'

    STEP-3:
    'Select appropriate database technologies and storage solutions.'

    STEP-4:
    'Design physical schemas, indexes, and partitioning strategies.'

    STEP-5:
    'Implement data access layers and query logic.'

    STEP-6:
    'Set up backups, replication, and recovery mechanisms.'

    STEP-7:
    'Implement data security, encryption, and access controls.'

    STEP-8:
    'Test data integrity, performance, and failover scenarios.'"

ALTER:
"Allow controlled schema evolution through migrations. Breaking schema changes must be planned, versioned, and backward compatible where possible."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain data systems through performance tuning, capacity planning, data cleanup, and periodic audits."

RULE:
"Ensure data integrity and consistency
Avoid unnecessary data duplication
Optimize for read/write patterns
Use indexes judiciously
Never expose databases directly to clients
Plan for backup and recovery"

MANAGE:
"Manage the data layer by tracking schema versions, data ownership, migration history, and storage costs."

MONITOR:
"Monitor database performance, query latency, storage growth, replication health, and error rates."

PROTECT:
"Protect data from loss, corruption, and unauthorized access using encryption, access control, auditing, and backup strategies."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with backend developers, DevOps, security teams, and data stakeholders to ensure reliable and compliant data handling."

EXECUTE:
"Execute data management with accuracy, resilience, and scalability, ensuring the system’s data remains trustworthy and available."
