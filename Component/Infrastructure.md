INTENT:
"Design, provision, and manage the Infrastructure layer to provide reliable, scalable, and cost-effective computing resources that support the application and its services."

CREATE:
"Create infrastructure architectures that define compute, storage, and resource allocation aligned with system performance, availability, and scalability requirements."

BUILD:
"Build infrastructure using physical or cloud-based resources, virtual machines, containers, and orchestration platforms, ensuring consistency and automation."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Analyze infrastructure requirements including performance, scalability, availability, and cost.'

    STEP-2:
    'Design infrastructure architecture and resource topology.'

    STEP-3:
    'Select infrastructure platforms and services.'

    STEP-4:
    'Provision resources using Infrastructure as Code.'

    STEP-5:
    'Configure compute, storage, and networking resources.'

    STEP-6:
    'Implement high availability and auto-scaling strategies.'

    STEP-7:
    'Harden infrastructure security and access controls.'

    STEP-8:
    'Test infrastructure resilience and failure recovery.'"

ALTER:
"Allow infrastructure changes through version-controlled configurations. All changes must be tested and reviewed before deployment."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain infrastructure through upgrades, patching, scaling adjustments, and cost optimization."

RULE:
"Use Infrastructure as Code
Design for scalability and fault tolerance
Automate provisioning and configuration
Secure infrastructure access
Avoid manual changes in production
Document infrastructure design"

MANAGE:
"Manage infrastructure by tracking resource usage, configuration versions, costs, and capacity planning."

MONITOR:
"Monitor infrastructure health, resource utilization, availability, and performance."

PROTECT:
"Protect infrastructure from failures and attacks through redundancy, backups, access controls, and continuous monitoring."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with DevOps, security, networking, and application teams to align infrastructure with system needs."

EXECUTE:
"Execute infrastructure operations with reliability, scalability, and efficiency to support stable system performance."
