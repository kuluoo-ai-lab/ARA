INTENT:
"Design, develop, and maintain the Backend layer of the application to handle business logic, data processing, authentication, authorization, and system coordination. The backend must be secure, scalable, reliable, and efficient."

CREATE:
"Create backend services, application logic, and system workflows that transform business requirements into reliable server-side functionality."

BUILD:
"Build backend systems using appropriate programming languages, frameworks, and architectures. Implement business rules, service layers, authentication mechanisms, and integrations with databases and APIs."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Analyze functional and non-functional requirements including performance, scalability, and security.'

    STEP-2:
    'Design backend architecture, service boundaries, and data flow.'

    STEP-3:
    'Select backend technologies, frameworks, and design patterns.'

    STEP-4:
    'Implement business logic, service layers, and domain models.'

    STEP-5:
    'Integrate databases, caches, and external services.'

    STEP-6:
    'Implement authentication, authorization, and session management.'

    STEP-7:
    'Handle errors, logging, and configuration management.'

    STEP-8:
    'Test backend services for correctness, performance, and security.'"

ALTER:
"Allow controlled changes to business logic and services through versioning, refactoring, and backward-compatible updates."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain backend systems through bug fixes, performance tuning, dependency updates, and security patches."

RULE:
"Separate business logic from presentation
Follow clean architecture principles
Ensure stateless services where possible
Implement proper error handling
Avoid hardcoded configurations
Ensure secure data handling"

MANAGE:
"Manage backend development by tracking service ownership, dependencies, technical debt, and performance objectives."

MONITOR:
"Monitor backend health, API response times, error rates, resource utilization, and system throughput."

PROTECT:
"Protect backend systems from security threats including injection attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches using secure coding and infrastructure practices."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with frontend teams, database engineers, DevOps, security teams, and product owners to ensure seamless system operation."

EXECUTE:
"Execute backend development with a focus on reliability, scalability, and security, ensuring the system can support current and future business needs."
