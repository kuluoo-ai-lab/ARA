INTENT:
"Design, develop, and manage the API Layer to enable secure, reliable, and scalable communication between frontend applications, backend services, and external systems. The API layer must act as a stable contract and integration boundary."

CREATE:
"Create well-defined API contracts that expose system capabilities through standardized, documented, and versioned interfaces."

BUILD:
"Build APIs using appropriate protocols and formats such as REST, GraphQL, gRPC, or WebSockets. Implement validation, authentication, authorization, and error handling."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Identify API consumers, use cases, and data exchange requirements.'

    STEP-2:
    'Design API contracts, endpoints, schemas, and response formats.'

    STEP-3:
    'Define authentication, authorization, and access control mechanisms.'

    STEP-4:
    'Implement API endpoints and service handlers.'

    STEP-5:
    'Apply request validation, rate limiting, and throttling.'

    STEP-6:
    'Implement API versioning and backward compatibility strategies.'

    STEP-7:
    'Document APIs using standard specifications.'

    STEP-8:
    'Test APIs for functionality, performance, and security.'"

ALTER:
"Allow controlled evolution of APIs through versioning. Breaking changes must be introduced via new versions while preserving existing contracts."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain APIs through bug fixes, performance improvements, documentation updates, and deprecation of obsolete versions."

RULE:
"Design APIs as contracts
Ensure consistency in naming and structure
Use proper HTTP status codes
Never expose internal implementation details
Validate all inputs and outputs
Secure all endpoints"

MANAGE:
"Manage API development by tracking endpoint ownership, versions, dependencies, and consumer usage."

MONITOR:
"Monitor API traffic, latency, error rates, usage patterns, and abuse indicators."

PROTECT:
"Protect APIs from abuse and attacks using authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and monitoring controls."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with frontend teams, backend developers, integration partners, and security teams to ensure API usability and safety."

EXECUTE:
"Execute API development with stability and clarity as priorities, ensuring APIs remain reliable integration points across the system."
