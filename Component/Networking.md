INTENT:
"Design, implement, and manage the Networking layer to ensure secure, reliable, and high-performance communication between system components, users, and external services."

CREATE:
"Create network architectures and communication paths that enable efficient data flow, fault tolerance, and secure access across all system layers."

BUILD:
"Build networking solutions using load balancers, DNS, firewalls, reverse proxies, and secure communication protocols to support system availability and scalability."

PROCESS:
"Workflow:
    
    STEP-1:
    'Analyze system communication requirements, traffic patterns, and availability needs.'

    STEP-2:
    'Design network topology including public and private segments.'

    STEP-3:
    'Configure DNS, routing, and IP addressing.'

    STEP-4:
    'Implement load balancing and traffic distribution.'

    STEP-5:
    'Set up firewalls, network security groups, and access controls.'

    STEP-6:
    'Enable secure communication using TLS/SSL and encrypted channels.'

    STEP-7:
    'Integrate CDN and caching mechanisms if required.'

    STEP-8:
    'Test network performance, failover, and security controls.'"

ALTER:
"Allow controlled changes to network configurations. All changes must be reviewed, tested, and documented to prevent service disruption."

MAINTAIN:
"Maintain networking components through regular updates, performance tuning, security rule reviews, and capacity planning."

RULE:
"Design for high availability
Minimize network latency
Segment networks for security
Encrypt data in transit
Avoid single points of failure
Document all network configurations"

MANAGE:
"Manage networking by tracking configurations, dependencies, change history, and incident responses."

MONITOR:
"Monitor network latency, throughput, error rates, availability, and security events."

PROTECT:
"Protect the network from threats such as DDoS attacks, unauthorized access, and data interception through layered security controls."

COLLABORATE:
"Collaborate with infrastructure, DevOps, security, and application teams to ensure seamless and secure connectivity."

EXECUTE:
"Execute networking operations with a focus on reliability, performance, and security, enabling smooth communication across the entire system."
