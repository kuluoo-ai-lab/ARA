INTENT:"We aim to design, develop, and deploy a website-based application that fulfills clearly defined business or user needs. The website should be scalable, secure, maintainable, and aligned with modern web standards, performance expectations, and user experience best practices."
CREATE:"Create a fully functional website based on the defined intent, requirements, and use cases. The website should include appropriate UI/UX design, front-end structure, back-end logic (if required), database integration (if applicable), and deployment-ready configuration."
BUILD:"Build the website using an appropriate and optimized technology stack (frontend, backend, database, APIs, and hosting). Ensure clean folder structure, modular components, reusable code, responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility, and adherence to coding standards."
PROCESS:"
Workflow:
  STEP-1:Understand the overall website purpose, target audience, and functional requirements.
  STEP-2:Identify or decide the best-suited tech stack (frameworks, libraries, CMS, or custom stack).
  STEP-3:Define the website architecture (pages, components, APIs, data flow).
  STEP-4:Design UI/UX wireframes and user flows.
  STEP-5:Implement frontend and backend features step-by-step.
  STEP-6:Integrate databases, APIs, authentication, and third-party services if needed.
  STEP-7:Test functionality, performance, responsiveness, and security.
  STEP-8:Prepare the website for deployment and future scaling."
RULE:"Follow web standards (HTML5, CSS3, ES6+).
Ensure clean, readable, and well-documented code.
Avoid deprecated, insecure, or unmaintained libraries.
Validate inputs and handle errors gracefully.
Optimize performance, SEO, and accessibility (WCAG).
Ensure compatibility across devices and browsers."
MAINTAIN:
"Maintain proper versioning for the website. Each update or enhancement must be logged with version numbers and change descriptions. Ensure the ability to rollback, redo, or restore previous versions when required."
MANAGE:"Manage all website assets, configurations, content, and versions centrally. Provide structured documentation for features, APIs, configurations, and dependencies. Allow easy monitoring of updates and changes through version control."
ALTER:"
Allow modifications based on user feedback or new requirements. Before applying changes, clearly understand the modification intent. If clarification is needed, request permission to ask targeted questions before proceeding with changes."
COLLBARATE:"Utilize available AI models collaboratively to improve code quality, reduce execution time, enhance safety, and ensure consistency across all generated outputs"
EXECUTE:"
Execute all defined steps by referencing the established intent, rules, process, and requirements. Ensure each stage of website creation aligns with performance, security, and usability expectations."
MONITOR:"
Continuously monitor website performance, user interactions, errors, logs, and system health. Define operational boundaries and ensure all activities remain within scope, security limits, and performance thresholds."
PROTECT:
"Ensure the website is secure against vulnerabilities by:
Regularly auditing dependencies and packages
Replacing outdated or vulnerable libraries
Implementing authentication, authorization, and data protection
Following best security practices (HTTPS, CSP, XSS/CSRF protection)"
